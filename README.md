## What's new in 1.5.0

- **Voice guidance:** fixed silent spoken directions and improved speech-engine startup and recovery.
- **Onboarding:** keep multiple favourite games selected, use UK English spelling and choose Twitter / X as your referral source.
- **Android Auto:** clearer launcher setup, with successful Desktop Head Unit checks. Real-car launcher availability remains under investigation.

[Full release notes and community shout-outs →](docs/releases/1.5.0.md)

## Your map, your world

Pick a world during onboarding, then explore real geography through its roads, typography, markers and navigation controls. Switch styles without losing your destination. The globe, world gallery and map are designed as one journey; the map itself remains readable while you travel.

After the first run, Waypoint opens your last selected world. Thanks to [u/cuberisk](https://www.reddit.com/user/cuberisk/) for suggesting that faster return to the map.

## Your world, on the dashboard

With a supported installation, connect your phone and open Waypoint from the car launcher. The projected map follows the world selected on your phone, with a full route line, turn cues and a camera that follows travel. Search or pick a saved destination on the car screen; shared destinations ask before Waypoint previews a route.

**Launcher availability:** a GitHub-sideloaded APK may not appear in a real car’s launcher. Android requires a trusted distribution channel for Car App Library apps; its “Unknown sources” option does not cover Waypoint. [Android Auto setup and testing →](docs/guide.md#android-auto)

<p><sub>Captured in the Android Auto Desktop Head Unit with a fixed public London demonstration route. The route and guidance state were simulated for the screenshots; no personal location was used. <a href="docs/images/promo/README.md">Capture and artwork notes</a>.</sub></p>

Android Auto keeps Google Maps available in the launcher. Open Waypoint there to use it as the current navigation app; installing it cannot change Android Auto's choice on its own. The car UI uses host-safe controls for search, saved destinations, voice, recenter and zoom. The phone remains the place to choose Car, Motorcycle or Walk.

## Built for the journey

- **Drive, ride or walk.** Choose a car, motorcycle or walking route, then follow spoken turns, remaining distance and ETA.
- **Take the route into the car.** Android Auto shows Waypoint's selected world, moving map, route and next turn. Search, saved destinations and map controls stay within the car's template UI.
- **Keep your bearings.** Locate recentres on your actual position; the map follows movement and can recalculate after a confirmed wrong turn. A 2D/3D control changes the camera tilt.
- **Find useful places.** Search destinations, drop a pin, and see world-specific blips for food, pubs, shops, schools, hospitals and other mapped places. Icons appear progressively as you zoom so dense streets stay legible.
- **Pick up where you left off.** Save places, revisit recent destinations and switch worlds during a trip. Shared `geo:` and `google.navigation:` links ask for confirmation before Waypoint looks up or previews the imported destination.
- **Send feedback in context.** Settings opens a draft GitHub issue with the current world and app version. You review it in your browser before submitting; a GitHub account is needed to post the issue.

## Get Waypoint

**[Download Waypoint.apk from GitHub Releases →](https://github.com/the-geeky-couldron/waypoint/releases/latest)**

1. Open the APK and follow Android’s installation prompts.
2. Complete onboarding, choose a world and open the map.
3. Tap **Locate** and grant precise location. Search for a destination or hold the map to drop a pin.
4. Choose **Car**, **Motorcycle** or **Walk**. Review the route, then tap **Start navigation**.

### Updating

Installed versions check for a newer stable GitHub release when Waypoint opens on the phone. If an update is available, an in-app prompt appears when the idle map is visible. Review the release notes, choose **Download update**, and confirm installation in Android.

The APK is checked against its checksum, package, version and installed signing identity. Waypoint shows What’s New once after a compatible update and keeps saved places and settings. This source tree is **Waypoint 1.5.0**; see the [release notes](docs/releases/current.md).

## Build from source

### iOS preview

A native iPhone/iPad port is available in this fork under [`ios/`](ios/README.md), with the same 27 map worlds and online routing services. It targets iOS 17 or later and distributes an unsigned IPA for **SideStore or AltStore Classic** through [iOS preview releases](https://github.com/sanskarjaiswal2001/waypoint/releases). See the [iOS guide](ios/README.md) for build instructions, sideloading and validation limits.

The 0.2.0 iOS preview adds the themed phone HUDs, shared artwork and fonts, POI icons, onboarding and remaining phone controls. The promotional screenshots above show Android; [the iOS parity guide](ios/PARITY.md) records what carries over and the platform differences.

### Android

You need **JDK 17**, Android **SDK Platform 36** and **Build Tools 35.0.0**. Set `ANDROID_HOME` or put your SDK path in the ignored `local.properties` file.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/the-geeky-couldron/waypoint.git
cd waypoint
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:lintDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

The Android build uses Kotlin, Jetpack Compose and MapLibre Native. No map API key, Node installation or Pillow (PIL) installation is needed to build the checked-in app.

Local release builds stay unsigned unless you supply distribution signing credentials; see the [release guide](docs/releasing.md).

<details>
<summary><strong>Artwork, motion assets and repository hygiene</strong></summary>

Pillow is used only by optional artwork-generation scripts. The three MP4s in `app/src/main/res/raw/` are runtime onboarding assets; their editable Remotion compositions and staging instructions are under [`tools/waypoint-motion`](tools/waypoint-motion/README.md).

Run `python3 scripts/check_repo_hygiene.py` before committing. CI checks that generated videos, source screenshots, private QA material, APKs and logs do not enter the repository. Runtime Android videos and the finished images used by this README are intentionally retained.

</details>

## Privacy and services

Waypoint has no app-owned account, analytics backend or recorded route history. Saved places stay on your device. Location and destinations are sent to providers when a map, search or route needs them; the app’s update check contacts GitHub without location data.

| Feature | Service |
| --- | --- |
| Map tiles and labels | OpenFreeMap using OpenStreetMap data |
| Search and reverse geocoding | Photon; Android Geocoder when available |
| Car routes | OSRM |
| Motorcycle and walking routes | Valhalla |
| Terrain | Mapzen |
| Voice | Your installed Android text-to-speech engine |
| Guidance progress and rerouting | Ferrostar 0.59.0 using OSRM and Valhalla routes |

### Practical limits

The public map, search and routing endpoints require internet access and can be unavailable or rate-limited. Waypoint has **no live traffic, offline routing or lane guidance**.

GPS and place coverage vary by device and location; real-road and long-duration testing are still needed. Read the [service and privacy guide](docs/guide.md#location-and-privacy) and [validation record](docs/validation.md) for the practical limits.
